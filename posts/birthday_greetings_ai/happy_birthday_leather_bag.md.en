You can use it right now or copy the provided prompt and use it with any other neural network ([ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [Claude 2](https://chat.claudeai.ai/), [Llama 2 70b](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ysharma/Explore_llamav2_with_TGI)).

I've tested the app with my friends, and they loved the results! The application creates unique and fun greetings that I'm sure you'll enjoy!

I would be very happy to receive your feedback and comments. Your opinion is very important to me and will help me make the application even better.

Here is the link to [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitalogos/birthday_greetings_ai), where you can learn more about the project.

P.S. To interact with the neural network, you need to get a free token, which will be enough for 50-100 greetings. Authorization is done through GitHub and takes less than a minute. But, if for some reason you can't authorize, write to me (see [contacts](https://logosnikita.com/contacts)), and I will help you :)

P.P.S. Initially, I planned that this would be an addition to my [birthday reminder](https://github.com/nikitalogos/birthday_reminder) app, but it seems to have turned into something more :)
